# Shopify Script in Python

1. Install Necessary libraries and Setup Virtual Environment
2. Libraries: Shopify-sdk for python, dotenv for keys, and maybe a JSON builder for creating and outputting the JSON File (will look more as I get basics out there.).
3. Environment has been Setup but it seems like I would need to use Requests either in REST or GraphQL instead of Shopify-sdk (Need password or Secret Key) 
4. I will give GraphQL a first try as I never worked with it before. If I can't get it working, I will use REST instead. (Will test first with POSTMAN)
5. I was able to access the endpoint but got errors with GRAPHQL endpoints. I will use REST API instead now. 
6. I was able to see all the products but I need to specifically point to the catalog collection. Found it through custom collections
7.
